# RE_React

<h2>Welcome to my REACT app!</h2>

<p>This app was created for people who invest (or hope invest) in real estate</p>

<p>Real estate has been a well known vehicle for investments but it not well known how people have made money by investing in real estate. Now, there are tv shows and pod casts on how people have made/lost money by investing in real estate.</p>

<p>With this app, the investor can dicuss the deals they are currently working on. This will allow people in the same market to see the activities or allow people outside of that immediate market to which market has high activity level/biggest return</p>

<p>To start the app, please make sure you are in the "re_invest" directory before running: npm start.</p>
